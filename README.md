# Bank Account Management System with Fraud Detection
A Java backend system that simulates bank accounts and transaction flows, complete with a fraud detection module powered by machine learning. Users can create accounts, perform transfers, deposits, and withdrawals, and view account balances and transaction histories. An integrated ML model (Isolation Forest) analyzes transaction patterns to flag potentially fraudulent activity in real time.
